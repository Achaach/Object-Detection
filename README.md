# Object-Detection

### Introduction
Object detection is a crucial task in the field of autonomous driving, traffic control, and surveillance systems. The project aims to develop an object detection system for highway scenes using deep learning techniques.
In this project we will build a object tracker to detect the cars on highway, based on Euclidean distance.
